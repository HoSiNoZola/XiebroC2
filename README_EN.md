## Main Features

- **Implant**: Written in Golang, compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS (support for mobile platforms under consideration for future updates).
- **Teamserver**: Built with .NET 6.0, does not require the .NET Core runtime environment.
- **Controller**: Supports reverse shell, file management, process management, network traffic monitoring, memory loading, reverse proxy (based on the [IOX](https://github.com/EddieIvan01/iox) model), screenshots, process injection and migration, AV/EDR detection, inline PowerShell commands.
- **Memory Operations**: Supports loading PE files into memory on Windows/Linux, process injection and migration, allowing file-free execution.
- **.NET Assemblies**: Execute .NET assemblies in memory (execute-assembly, inline-assembly).
- **Lua Scripting**: Extend command centers and menus through Lua scripts (similar to CNA scripts).
- **Custom RDI Shellcode**: (64-bit only, 32-bit requires manual client compilation) or generate shellcode using [donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut) or [Godonut](https://github.com/Binject/go-donut).
- **Telegram Integration**: Set up Telegram notifications for host check-ins by modifying the `profile.json` parameters for Chat ID and API Token.

## Supported Platforms

**Implant (Session)**

- **Windows**: Windows 7–11, Windows Server 2008–2022
- **Linux**: Supports glibc 2.17+ (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)
- **MacOS**: macOS 10.15+

The project is compiled using Go 1.20 for compatibility. Note that Go 1.20+ does not support Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and some older Linux systems. The payload in XiebroC2 only supports x64 architecture. For older systems, you must compile the source code with Go versions 1.19–1.16.

**Teamserver**

- **Windows**: Windows 8–11, Windows Server 2012–2022
- **Linux**: Supports glibc 2.17+ systems.
